## Gerenating a 8-bit version of any piece of music (mostly classical, of course)

- Motivation

    Months ago I just discoved the 8-bit music and an awesome YouTube channel called [AMPlified Music](https://www.youtube.com/@AMPlified_Music), having published several 8-bit versions of classical pieces like the 2nd symphony of Mahler, 4th Brandenburg of Bach, and several other pieces I love from Mussorgsky, Rossini, Tchaikovsky, etc... Then I thought *what if I code a program that converts normal music into 8-bit music*?

- Choose of the language

    C this time? Probably haskell again? 

## Editing audio - improving for voice - via scripting

- Motivation

    When I began to record myself, I noticed how I knew nothing about digital audio and how to edit my recording without looking for tips on YouTube -- and lets agree that it's always frustrating! So firstly I needed to study how digital audio works. 

    Then, I got bored editing the tracks in Audacity -- why not automatize the aplying of what I need through scripting?

- Choose of the language

    Python?..


## Making a cli tool for book collection managing

- Motivation
    
    When you've any collection, you want to have a catalogue, right? Since my bookshelf has no free space anymore, I need urgently to organize the collection, but I didn't like any of the softwares I found. I'm an enthisiat of minimalist software, and in these cases, there's no better solution than writing the software myself -- since its a pretty simple case. 

- Choose of the language

    Well, I'm learning Haskell, that's why... But there's another reason why Haskell: because it's a compiled language, I want to release it with a binary executable instead of a script that always requires dependencies (they are excluded by the principle of minimalism).
