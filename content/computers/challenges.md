## Gerenating a 8-bit version of any piece of music (mostly classical, of course)

- Motivation

    Months ago I just discoved the 8-bit music and an awesome YouTube channel called [AMPlified Music](https://www.youtube.com/@AMPlified_Music), having published several 8-bit versions of classical pieces like the 2nd symphony of Mahler, 4th Brandenburg of Bach, and several other pieces I love from Mussorgsky, Rossini, Tchaikovsky, etc... Then I thought *what if I code a program that converts normal music into 8-bit music*?
