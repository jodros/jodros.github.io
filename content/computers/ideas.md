I've a lot of programming ideas all the time but usually I don't have the technical knowledge to carry them out lol. Anyway, here they are, if anyone else is searching for ideas...

### Gerenating a 8-bit version of any piece of music (mostly classical, of course)

*status: ...*

Months ago I just discoved the 8-bit music and an awesome YouTube channel called **[AMPlified Music](https://www.youtube.com/@AMPlified_Music)**, having published several 8-bit versions of classical pieces like the 2nd symphony of Mahler, 4th Brandenburg of Bach, and several other pieces I love from Mussorgsky, Rossini, Tchaikovsky, etc... Then I thought *what if I code a program that converts normal music into 8-bit music*? I don't even know whether this is feasible...

### Editing audio - improving for voice - via scripting

*status: maybe someday...*

When I began to record myself, I noticed how I knew nothing about digital audio and how to edit my recording without looking for tips on YouTube -- and lets agree that it's always frustrating! So firstly I needed to study how digital audio works. Then, I got bored editing the tracks in Audacity -- why not automatize the aplying of what I need through scripting?

### Making a cli tool for book collection managing

*status: under development*

When you've any collection, you want to have a catalogue, right? Since my bookshelf has no free space anymore, I need urgently to organize the collection, but I didn't like any of the softwares I found over there. In these cases, there's no better solution than writing the software myself -- since its a pretty simple case.
