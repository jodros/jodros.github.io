I am an undergraduate student of Portuguese and Russian languages at University of SÃ£o Paulo. I am also a free software enthusiast.

Sometimes I publish videos related to this website content in my **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jodros-xyz>)** as well. You can find me at **[Github](https://github.com/jodros/)** too.

Currently I'm working on **[extend.sile](https://github.com/jodros/extend.sile)**.
