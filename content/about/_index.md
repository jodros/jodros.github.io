I am an undergraduate student of Portuguese and Russian languages at University of SÃ£o Paulo. I am also a free software enthusiast.

Sometimes I publish videos related to this website content in my YouTube channel {{< static src="<https://www.youtube.com/@jodros-xyz>" text="(link)" >}} as well. You can find me at {{< static src="<https://github.com/jodros/>" text="Github" >}} too.

Currently I'm working on {{< static src="<https://github.com/jodros/extend.sile>" text="extend.sile" >}}.
