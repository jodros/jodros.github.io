I am an undergraduate student of Portuguese and Russian languages at University of SÃ£o Paulo. I am also a free software enthusiast.

Sometimes I publish videos related to this website content in my **{{< static src="<https://www.youtube.com/@jodros-xyz>" text="YouTube channel" >}}** as well. You can find me at **{{< static src="<https://github.com/jodros/>" text="Github" >}}** too.

Currently I'm working on **{{< static src="<https://github.com/jodros/extend.sile>" text="extend.sile" >}}**.
