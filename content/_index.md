This website is intended to be an *open notebook*, my home on the internet.

<!-- My reasons why **[here]({{ ref "broadcasts.md" }})**. -->

I am an undergraduate student of Portuguese and Russian languages at University of SÃ£o Paulo, the purpose of publishing my own notes and other stuff **is not** to teach but just to share *as a learner* -- and have an archive of my own progress as well -- so I will write and update it as I learn about the subjetcs, no definitive texts here. My interests are not solely regarding humanities since I am also a free software enthusiast and love computer science as a whole so sometimes my content is about it.

Planning to run a **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTPvakiIaL2Z1F9UNCOml6g)** with the same idea of this website, maybe someday...

<!-- Currently I'm working on **[extend.sile](https://github.com/jodros/extend.sile)**. -->

Please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jodros/jodros.github.io/issues/new) if you see any mistake or even a minor typo in my posts. You can contact me via **[ e-mail](mailto:jopealqui@gmail.com)** if you have questions or want to discuss any approached subject further.
